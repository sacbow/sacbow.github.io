I am a PhD candidate at the University of Tokyo, working on computational imaging, Bayesian inference, and software engineering.

My research interests include:
- (Computational aspects of) Bayesian Inference
- Scientific Imaging (especially phase retrieval)
- Parallel Computing (using GPU)
- (Embedded) domain-specific languages

Outside of research, I have also contributed to **The University of Tokyo Newspaper (東京大学新聞社)**,
a student-run newspaper operated by a public-interest foundation.  
I have written several articles on science, technology, and student life in UT.

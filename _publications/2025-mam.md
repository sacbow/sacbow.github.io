We propose a **three-dimensional deconvolution algorithm** for large-angle illumination **ADF-STEM depth sectioning**, enabling improved depth resolution in atomic-scale imaging.  
The method is based on **Vector Approximate Message Passing (VAMP)**, a Bayesian inference algorithm that incorporates prior knowledge of the reconstructed image.  
Applied to simulated datasets of Ce-doped w-AlN, the approach achieves sharper localization of dopant atoms along the depth axis compared to conventional methods, demonstrating its effectiveness for **3D defect characterization** in crystalline materials.

**Keywords:** ADF-STEM, Deconvolution, Depth Sectioning, Bayesian Inference, Approximate Message Passing, 3D Reconstruction

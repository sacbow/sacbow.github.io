We present a **Bayesian framework** for estimating the **phonon dispersion relation** from X-ray thermal diffuse scattering (TDS) patterns, with full **uncertainty quantification**.  
By analyzing TDS patterns with **random incident orientations**, the method achieves more accurate reconstruction of phonon dispersions compared to conventional high-symmetry-plane measurements.  
The approach leverages the **Exchange Monte Carlo (EMC)** algorithm for efficient sampling from complex probabilistic landscapes, providing a robust estimation strategy for lattice dynamics.

**Keywords:** Phonon Dispersion, Thermal Diffuse Scattering, Bayesian Inference, Exchange Monte Carlo, Uncertainty Quantification

We demonstrate **light-induced control of the spin-Peierls phase** in a quasi-one-dimensional molecular solid, K-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ).  
Using **phase-locked mid-infrared pulses** to excite intramolecular vibrations, we observed **charge–spin modulated Floquet states** that destabilize the spin-Peierls dimerization.  
Time-resolved reflectivity measurements revealed high-frequency oscillations associated with electron- and spin-density modulations synchronized with the vibrational mode.  
These results establish **intramolecular vibrational excitation** as an effective approach for **Floquet engineering in molecular solids**.

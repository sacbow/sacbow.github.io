We propose a **stochastic extension of Vector Approximate Message Passing (VAMP)** for large-scale Bayesian inverse problems.  
The algorithm enables efficient uncertainty quantification and improved convergence in **phase retrieval** tasks under measurement noise.  
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed stochastic VAMP method achieves robust reconstruction and faster convergence than deterministic baselines.

**Keywords:** Phase Retrieval, Bayesian Inference, Approximate Message Passing, Belief Propagation, Inverse Problems, Imaging
